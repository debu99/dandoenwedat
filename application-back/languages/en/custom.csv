"NETWORK_VIEWS_SCRIPTS_ADMINMANAGE_INDEX_DESCRIPTION";"Networks are generally used for determining what members see in the ""what's new"" feed, letting members associate with each other based on common profile information (without needing to be connections directly), and serving advertisements to specific groups of members. Each member can join one or more networks if you allow them to, and their networks will be shown on their profile. If you decide to have networks, be sure that they relate to your community's theme. For example, if your community has members from various countries, you can create a network for each country. If you want your members to see recent posts from other people in their networks (even if they're not yet connections with each other), you can adjust that setting %s."

By creating ad campaigns, you can determine exactly where your ads will appear, how long they will be displayed, and who they will be shown to. The key to generating substantial revenue from your social network is to create targeted ad campaigns. This means that you should make an effort to show specific ads to users based on their interests or personal characteristics (e.g. their profile information). To accomplish this, ad campaigns can be created for specific user levels and/or networks."

This will be the default timezone applied to users' accounts if they do not select a timezone during signup, or if they are not signed in. Select the default locale you want to use on your social network. This will affect the language of the dates that appear on your social network pages."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_SPAM_DESCRIPTION";"Social networks are often the target of aggressive spam tactics. This most often comes in the form of fake user accounts and spam in comments. On this page, you can manage various anti-spam and censorship features. Note: To turn on the signup image verification feature (a popular anti-spam tool), see the Signup Progress page."
"CORE_VIEWS_SCRIPTS_ADMINMENU_INDEX_DESCRIPTION";"Use this area to manage the various navigation menus that appear on your social network. When you select the menu you wish to edit, a list of the menu items it contains will be shown. You can drag these items up and down to change their order."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_DESCRIPTION";"For very large social networks,
it may be necessary to enable caching to improve performance. If there is a noticeable
decrease in performance on your social network, consider enabling caching below
(or upgrading your hardware). Caching takes some load off the database server by
storing commonly retrieved data in temporary files (file-based caching) or memcached
(memory-based caching). If you are not familiar with caching, we do not recommend
that you change any of these settings."
"CORE_FORM_ADMIN_SETTINGS_PERFORMANCE_ENABLE_DESCRIPTION";"Enable caching? Enabling
caching will decrease the CPU
usage of your database server (resulting in a decrease of page load
times). While some non-critical data may appear slightly out of date,
this will usually not be noticeable to users. For example, some of the
general site statistics on your homepage may take longer to update.
This will not be noticeable if your social network is already large and
populated with a lot of data"
